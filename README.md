# Glastonbury Schedule Planning
 
In the week between the publication of the Glastonbury timings and the app release, I wanted to check whether there were any clashes for the acts I wanted to see.

I created one tool in Python to list all the acts that clashed with a suggested act.

I created another tool that sorted a suggested list of acts according to the day and time of the performance, allowing me to see when my busy and quiet times would be.
