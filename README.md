# Glastonbury Schedule Planning
 
In the week between the publication of the Glastonbury timings and the app release, I wanted to check whether there were any clashes for the acts I wanted to see.

I have summarised the two tools below. The original code is included in the python file Glasto.ipynb.

I created one tool in Python to list all the acts that clashed with a suggested act.

I created another tool that sorted a suggested list of acts according to the day and time of the performance, allowing me to see when my busy and quiet times would be.

I could see that some tough decisions had to be made on Saturday night and that I should explore the schedule on Saturday afternoon because I would have time to see another act then.
